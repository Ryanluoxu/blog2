origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```
- If HTTPS:
```bash
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

## git push without entering username & password

### HTTPS
For the repo which is cloned from GitHub using HTTPS, use a credential helper to remember username and password.

With Git for Windows, run the following commands to store credentials:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

### SSH
For the repo which is cloned from GitHub using SSH, use SSH keys. -> [Generating an SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key)
